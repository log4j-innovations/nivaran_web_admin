Notifications System Design
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hierarchy of Notifications

Notifications are role-based and priority-sensitive:

Role	Notification Type	Purpose / Trigger
Citizen	Issue Created / Status Updated / Resolution	Keep citizens informed about their reported issues
Field Supervisor	New Assignment / SLA Warning / Escalation	Alerts about new tasks, pending deadlines, and critical issues
City Engineer	Escalation / High Severity Issues / Reports	Monitor SLA breaches, supervise field work, review critical area issues
Super Admin	System Health / SLA Breach / Department Alert	System-wide alerts, performance issues, compliance notifications
Auditor	Compliance Alerts / Reports Ready	Tracks compliance and audit-related notifications
2Ô∏è‚É£ Notification Templates

Each notification has a template with dynamic fields. Examples:

Citizen Notifications

Event	Template	Channels
Issue Created	‚ÄúYour report [ISSUE_TITLE] has been received. Expected resolution by [SLA_DEADLINE].‚Äù	Push, Email, SMS
Status Updated	‚ÄúYour report [ISSUE_TITLE] is now [STATUS]. Field supervisor: [SUPERVISOR_NAME].‚Äù	Push, Email
Resolution Confirmed	‚ÄúYour reported issue [ISSUE_TITLE] has been resolved. Thank you for reporting.‚Äù	Push

Field Supervisor Notifications

Event	Template	Channels
New Assignment	‚ÄúNew issue assigned: [ISSUE_TITLE] in [AREA_NAME]. Priority: [PRIORITY].‚Äù	Push, Email
SLA Warning	‚ÄúSLA approaching: [ISSUE_TITLE] must be resolved by [SLA_DEADLINE].‚Äù	Push, Email
Escalation	‚ÄúCritical escalation: [ISSUE_TITLE] escalated to City Engineer. Take action immediately.‚Äù	Push

City Engineer Notifications

Event	Template	Channels
SLA Breach / Escalation	‚Äú[ISSUE_TITLE] in [AREA_NAME] breached SLA. Assigned to [SUPERVISOR_NAME].‚Äù	Push, Email
Area Performance Alert	‚ÄúResolution rate in [AREA_NAME] dropped below [THRESHOLD]%.‚Äù	Push, Email
Reports Ready	‚Äú[REPORT_NAME] is available for review.‚Äù	Email

Super Admin Notifications

Event	Template	Channels
System Health Alert	‚ÄúDatabase/storage/network issue detected. Severity: [SEVERITY]. Immediate action required.‚Äù	Email, Push
SLA Breach / Compliance	‚ÄúDepartment [DEPARTMENT_NAME] SLA compliance below [THRESHOLD]%.‚Äù	Email, Push
User Activity Anomaly	‚ÄúSuspicious activity detected: [USER_NAME], [ACTION].‚Äù	Email

Auditor Notifications

Event	Template	Channels
Report Ready	‚Äú[REPORT_NAME] is ready for download.‚Äù	Email
Compliance Alert	‚ÄúAudit discrepancy detected in [AREA_NAME] for period [PERIOD].‚Äù	Email, Push
3Ô∏è‚É£ Notification Channels
Channel	Description
Push	Real-time notifications in the citizen or authority apps. Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
Email	Detailed notifications or reports. Useful for city engineers, super admins, auditors.


Note: Push notifications can include deep-links to dashboards or specific issue pages.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Escalation Rules

Purpose: Ensure SLA compliance and timely resolution of critical issues.

Trigger	Escalation Path	SLA Time Frame Example (Indian context)
SLA Deadline Approaching	Field Supervisor ‚Üí City Engineer ‚Üí Super Admin	High Priority: 24 hours ‚Üí escalate every 4 hours remaining
Issue Not Updated	Field Supervisor ‚Üí City Engineer	Medium Priority: 48 hours ‚Üí escalate once daily
Critical Severity Issue	Field Supervisor ‚Üí City Engineer ‚Üí Super Admin ‚Üí Auditor	Immediate push/SMS alert
Repeated SLA Breach	City Engineer ‚Üí Super Admin	Automatic daily notification

Implementation Notes:

Escalation is automated in the Firestore Cloud Functions.

Each escalation triggers multi-channel notifications based on role and severity.

Notifications should include timestamp, issue link, and priority.

Auditors receive only summary or compliance-related notifications, not individual issue updates.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Firebase Implementation

Collection: notifications

Document Structure:

interface Notification {
  id: string;
  issueId?: string;
  recipientId: string;
  recipientRole: 'citizen' | 'field_supervisor' | 'city_engineer' | 'super_admin' | 'auditor';
  type: 'issue_created' | 'status_updated' | 'sla_warning' | 'escalation' | 'report_ready' | 'system_alert';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  channels: ('push' | 'email' )[];
  isRead: boolean;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt?: Timestamp;
}


Cloud Functions monitor issues collection and generate notifications automatically:

On Create / Update: Notify citizen, supervisor.

On SLA Breach: Notify supervisor, engineer, admin.

On Escalation: Notify next level in hierarchy.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Firebase Implementation

Collections: analytics_metrics, area_metrics, user_metrics

Data Example (Firestore Document):

interface AreaMetrics {
  areaId: string;
  period: DateRange;
  totalIssues: number;
  resolvedIssues: number;
  averageResolutionTime: number; // in hours
  slaCompliance: number; // percentage
  hotspots: GeoPoint[];
  severityBreakdown: Record<'minor'|'moderate'|'major'|'critical', number>;
  priorityBreakdown: Record<'low'|'medium'|'high'|'critical', number>;
}

interface UserMetrics {
  userId: string;
  period: DateRange;
  issuesAssigned: number;
  issuesResolved: number;
  averageResolutionTime: number;
  slaCompliance: number;
  feedbackScore: number; // 1-5
}

Maps & Routes Specification
1. API Integration

Google Maps API Key: Use a restricted key for web dashboard.

Services Used:

Maps JavaScript API ‚Üí Interactive maps

Directions API ‚Üí Route calculation

Places API ‚Üí Auto-suggest locations for issue creation

Geocoding API ‚Üí Convert addresses to coordinates for Firestore storage

Security: Restrict key to HTTP referrers (your domain) and enable usage logging.

const GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;

2. Coordinates & GeoData

All issue locations, area boundaries, and user assignments are stored as GeoPoint objects in Firestore.

Example:

interface GeoPoint {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
}

// Example issue location
const issueLocation: GeoPoint = { latitude: 28.6139, longitude: 77.2090 }; // Delhi


Areas: Boundaries defined as arrays of coordinates (polygons) for districts, zones, or neighborhoods.

interface Area {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  boundaries: GeoPoint[]; // Polygon coordinates
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
}

3. Heatmap Rules

Purpose: Show concentration of active or critical issues per area.

Data Source: issues collection with status and priority.

Color Coding (Municipal Theme):

Green ‚Üí Low density / safe

Yellow ‚Üí Medium density / in-progress

Red ‚Üí High density / critical issues

const heatmapColors = [
  { density: 'low', color: '#16a34a' }, // Success green
  { density: 'medium', color: '#eab308' }, // Warning yellow
  { density: 'high', color: '#dc2626' }, // Danger red
];


Intensity Calculation: Weight by priority (critical > high > medium > low)

const heatmapWeight = (priority: string) => {
  switch (priority) {
    case 'critical': return 3;
    case 'high': return 2;
    case 'medium': return 1;
    default: return 0.5;
  }
};

4. Route Optimization Logic

Purpose: Provide field supervisors best paths for multiple assignments.

Data Input:

Supervisor‚Äôs current location

List of assigned issues (coordinates)

Road closures or hazards (optional)

Algorithm:

Google Directions API ‚Üí Calculate shortest route with multiple waypoints.

Optional custom optimization: Solve Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for multiple issues in one zone.

Example:

const getOptimizedRoute = async (start: GeoPoint, stops: GeoPoint[]) => {
  const waypoints = stops.map(s => `${s.latitude},${s.longitude}`).join('|');
  const url = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${start.latitude},${start.longitude}&destination=${start.latitude},${start.longitude}&waypoints=optimize:true|${waypoints}&key=${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}`;
  // Fetch and parse JSON ‚Üí return optimized order & polyline
};


Mobile Optimization: Field supervisors see the optimized route on map with touch-friendly markers and live updates.

5. Markers & Icons

Icons by Priority / Status:

Pending ‚Üí üü° Yellow marker

In Progress ‚Üí üü† Orange marker

Critical ‚Üí üî¥ Red marker

Resolved ‚Üí üü¢ Green marker

Clicking Marker: Opens IssueDetails card ‚Üí option to update status, add photo, or navigate.

6. Real-Time Map Updates

Firestore snapshot listeners ‚Üí update pins/heatmap dynamically as issues are created/updated/resolved.

This setup fully respects your design.md structure:

Roles ‚Üí City Engineer & Field Supervisor will use this heavily.

SLA & workflow ‚Üí Critical issues escalate, reflected on map heatmap.

Analytics ‚Üí Maps integrate with hotspot analysis.

Mobile-first ‚Üí Touch optimized with bottom navigation.
